      "contents": "\nExperience\nAfter graduating from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies and Sociology, I spent 7 years working in environmental education to inspire the next generation of environmental stewards. From an outdoor school in the Santa Cruz Mountains to an elementary school in the urban jungle of San Francisco I developed transformation educational experiences for youth from diverse backgrounds.\nRight before coming to Bren I worked as the Restoration Education Specialist with Save the Bay. I worked to protect and restore wetland habitat by leading community-based restoration programs. I increased the native biodiversity in the transition zone of tidal marshes by engaging volunteers and students in invasive species removal, native plant propagation, installation, and shoreline cleanups. I love working with a wide array of people and sharing with them the importance and beauty of wetlands and the natural world. I am successful and passionate in fostering a citizenry that engages with and protects the natural environment.\nInterests\nMy focus at the Bren school lies in the intersection of water resource management, conservation planning, environmental justice, responsible data management, and strategic environmental communication. I am passionate about communicating science to the public through data visualization, storytelling, public speaking and writing to motivate sustainable behavioral change.\nThe interdisciplinary course load at the Bren School has enabled me to successfully communicate with people working in various sectors, such as business, economics, policy, politics, law, and the sciences. I am confident and successful in bringing people together from various disciplines to solve complex environmental problems.\nIn my free time I love to play music with friends, explore various trails through running, hiking and backpacking, cook, and surf.\n\n\n\n",

We identified priority areas to implement multiple benefit aquifer recharge projects that utilize natural infrastructure. We mapped geospatial models in ArcGIS using publcially avaialble scientific data to prioritize areas that could achieve floodplain mitigation benefits and ecosystem enhancement benefits. We also designed a shiny application to communicate results to stakeholders.\nTo learn more about our project check out our website: https://floodforward.wixsite.com/website\nCommunciation’s Capstone\nTo be completed in late spring\n\n\n\n",
