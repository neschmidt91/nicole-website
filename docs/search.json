I am passionate about finding nature based solutions to water infrastructure problems. The interdisciplinary course load at the Bren School has enabled me to successfully communicate with people working in various sectors, such as business, economics, policy and politics, law, and the sciences. I am confident and successful in bringing people together from various disciplines to solve complex environmental problems.\n\n\n\n",

We identified priority areas to implement multiple benefit aquifer recharge projects that utilize natural infrastructure through a geospatial model in ArcGIS using publcially avaialble scientific data. Prioritization centered around areas in Madera County that could receive flood risk mitigation benefits and ecosystem enhancement benefits from flood managed aquifer recharge. We also created a shiny application to communicate results to stakeholders. To learn more about our project check out our website: https://floodforward.wixsite.com/website\nCommunciation’s Capstone\nTo be completed in late spring\n\n\n\n",
