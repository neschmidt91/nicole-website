### Interests

My focus at the Bren school lies in the intersection of water resource management, conservation planning, environmental justice, and strategic environmental communication. I am passionate about finding nature based solutions to water infrastructure problems. The interdisciplinary course load at the Bren School has enabled me to successfully communicate with people working in various sectors, such as business, economics, policy and politics, law, and the sciences. I am confident and successful in bringing people together from various disciplines to solve complex environmental problems.
