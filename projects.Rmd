### Projects 

#### Master's Group Project (thesis equivalent)
For my Master's project, my group and I analyzed floodplain restoration opportunities in Madera County. We identified priority areas to implement multiple benefit aquifer recharge projects that utilize natural infrastructure. We mapped geospatial models in ArcGIS using publcially avaialble scientific data to prioritize areas that could achieve floodplain mitigation benefits and ecosystem enhancement benefits. We also designed a shiny application to communicate results to stakeholders.
