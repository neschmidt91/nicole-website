Welcome! My name is Nicole. I am a trained environmental scientist and manager finishing up my Master's at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management (UCSB). I am passionate about finding nature based solutions to environmental problems. This website contains information about my past work and various data analysis projects that I have worked on using R programming. Please reach out if you would like to chat or collaborate.
